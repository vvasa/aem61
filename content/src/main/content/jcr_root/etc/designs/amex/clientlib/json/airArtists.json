			"Slim Jxmmi and Swae Lee were born in California, but moved to Tupelo, Mississippi at an early age, where they were raised in the notorious Ida Street housing projects, some of the worst, most crime-ridden in the state. Making matters worse, Sremmurd’s parents split while the brothers were still young, a devastating turn of events that found the brothers seeking shelter in abandoned homes. Music, from a young age, became a way for Jxmmi and Lee to escape the desperation of their surroundings. “When we were growing up, it was just about perseverance,” says Slim Jxmmi.",
			"The brothers began throwing parties and shows around town, often in the same abandoned buildings where they once stayed. The pair always had larger ambitions and so the brothers taught themselves how to record, make beats, and DJ, building enough buzz to earn an appearance on BET’s 106 & Park. Lee and Jxmmi were introduced to Mike WiLL, and the multi-platinum producer immediately signed the duo to his label, Ear Drummer Records.",
			"Rae Sremmurd’s first single under the Ear Drummer Records, “No Flex Zone,” was a breakout for the duo, becoming a cultural touchstone throughout 2014 and entering Billboard’s Hot 100 and Top 40, earning the brothers a performance on the 2014 BET Hip-Hop Awards. “No Type,” proved even bigger, peaking at number 16 on Billboard’s Top 40 charts and earning the duo their first late night appearance on The Tonight Show. In 2015, Rae Sremmurd released their first album, SremmLife, with a top 5 debut on the Billboard Top 200 and a number 1 debut on Billboard Hip-Hop. Throw Sum Mo, featuring Nicki Minaj & Young Thug, emerged as their third consecutive single to break into the top 10 at urban radio and second consecutive single to peak at #1. “It’s the energy, that’s what #SremmLife is all about” says Swae Lee."

			"",
			"In this secluded, canopied space, BØRNS wrote and often recorded the songs on his forthcoming debut EP Candy, which filters the singer’s naturally moody, sensual sound through “an explosion of sunlight,”as he puts it. “You can feel the sunshine and hear the echoes of the canyon in these songs. The soaring harmonies all came out of singing from the treetops.”The shimmering feel of the EP does conjure images of exactly the kind of bohemian Never Never Land that inspired it. “When you feel an emotion so visceral and potent, the songs write themselves,”he says. “I didn't consciously write it, all of the vocals were first takes, it came from the feeling of longing and the world slowing down when you dive deep into love."

			"Already on his way to becoming one of 2015’s international crossover-stories, Gavin James is a 22-year-old artist who grew up in a Dublin suburb. Music was arguably in Gavin’s blood: his maternal great-grandparents were both famous Irish Opera singers. James began playing guitar at age eight. After years of playing Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin covers in the garden shed, he joined a band while in his teens and was drafted as its singer.",
			"Inspired by local heroes like Damien Rice and classic soul artists such as Sam Cooke, Gavin played marathon three-hour shows at Dublin’s pubs during college, often performing seven nights a week. His original material soon began to draw an impassioned following. James’ very first single won Ireland’s answer to the Mercury –the Choice Prize for Song Of The Year. Say Hello, James’ Irish debut EP, charted for more than six months, leading to a string of sold-out headline dates and supporting tours with such artists as Lianne La Havas, Beth Orton and Marina & The Diamonds.",
			"In 2014, James recorded a rapturously received hometown show at Whelans. The resulting album, Live at Whelans – released by Capitol Records in the U.S. and by GS Believe internationally – climbed to #1 on iTunes in Ireland shortly after the pre-order launched. Diffuser.FM hailed Live at Whelans as “intriguing…an addictive first tug in what promises to be a lengthy assault on listeners’ heartstrings.” James is the first artist ever to sell out the historic Olympia Theatre in Dublin before releasing a studio album. While writing and recording his forthcoming debut studio album, he had a national TV performance on The Late, Late Show with James Corden and continues to tour Europe and the U.S., including support slots opening this past Spring for Kodaline and Tori Kelly and Sam Smith’s summer 2015 US tour."
