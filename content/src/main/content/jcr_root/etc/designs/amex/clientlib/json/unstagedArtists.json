It was a concert that showcased the evolution of the band’s unique rock sound, as they delighted the audience with songs old and new. Their album Circuital was released the same day as the performance, and American Express UNSTAGED fans were among the first to hear some of the new songs played live.",

Throughout the series, Armisen made it his mission to choose the best band member — he wanted to crown the “King of Kings of Leon.” This episodic content, along with other skits, helped build excitement leading up to the live performance.",
			"On August 9, 2013, Kings of Leon took the stage at Shepherd’s Bush in London to perform for a sold-out crowd. Countless other fans from around the world streamed the show at home. Those who tuned in early were treated to special preshow content in which Armisen kicked off the performance while playing with tiny replica figures of each band member. Fans got to hear old favorites like “Use Somebody” and “The Bucket,” as well as tracks from their 2013 album Mechanical Bull",

			"Von Furstenberg’s 40th Anniversary show was truly a feast for the eyes and ears as she unveiled her 2014 Fall/Winter Collection alongside a live performance from St. Vincent. St. Vincent’s original and electric sound was the perfect soundtrack to accompany the colorful, bold patterns that strutted down the catwalk.",
			"Backstage, photographer Cole Rise snapped pics of the action behind the curtain and uploaded them in real time. Fans got an intimate view of the production team, models, and stylists who help fashion shows come to life.",
			"The live-streamed event gave every fan the best seat in the house. And fans who joined the conversation with #AmexUNSTAGED during the show were granted digital access to a second performance by St. Vincent, where she debuted new songs “Rattlesnake” and “Birth in Reverse” from her 2014 self-titled album, St. Vincent.",

			"And on September 18, 2012, The Killers took the stage at the Paradise Theater in the Bronx, New York. Online fans who tuned in early could catch pre-show content that featured the band warming up. And when the show finally started, the band kicked off with the song “Runaways” from their album Battle Born, which was released the same day. The energetic crowd also rocked out to old favorites like “Mr. Brightside” and “Human.”",
			"During the performance, online fans submitted photos with signs showing their names and hometowns. Those photos were projected onto two giant screens on stage, allowing the live audience to connect with the digital fans. It was an experience that put fans at the heart of the music at an absolutely killer show."

			"With a sparkling ocean, white sand, a ferris wheel, and a rollercoaster as the backdrop, Wildwood Beach was the perfect spot for Kenny Chesney’s American Express UNSTAGED concert. Chesney performed an epic set of 27 songs, including favorites like “She Thinks My Tractor’s Sexy,” “No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problem,” and “You and Tequila.” ",
			"It was an unforgettable summer night that Chesney fans will remember for years to come."

			"Sugarland’s American Express UNSTAGED experience gave fans rare access into the lives of members Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush. Before the live performance, fans got a chance to join the conversation by tweeting questions to the duo using #AmexSugarland. They were then able to tune in to see if their questions were answered in a series of filmed discussions led by Ortega.",
			"The live-streamed performance was held at New York City’s Best Buy Theater on October 18, 2010. Online fans could choose their own camera angle for a customized viewing experience that took them inside the action. The show coincided with the duo’s release of their album The Incredible Machine, and the audience was the first to hear the live debut of the album’s hit single “Tonight.”Throughout the performance, special guests Jon Bon Jovi, Ronnie Dunn, Little Big Town, and others joined Sugarland on stage, taking an already fun show to the next level."

			"With a Grammy for Best Dance Album, record-breaking album sales, and numerous nominations for Brit Awards and the Mercury Music Prize, Disclosure has seen a meteoric rise that continues to cast a profound influence on the musical landscape this decade. It’s amazing when you think they achieved all this as teenagers, just out of school. With ‘Caracal’, their sophomore album, they assert themselves as platinum-grade songwriters. There’s a renewed depth and skill to this latest work they say, “It’s songwriting in its classic form, songs you can play on the piano.”",
			"Their latest material shows off the newly pronounced roles within Disclosure: Guy takes the reins as producer, as Howard moves to the foreground of songwriting. “We wanted to write songs with loads of singers so there are no instrumentals.” says Howard. “When you get the chance to work with amazing people you want to make the most of them.” ‘Holding On’ features the Sacramento-born, Grammy award-winning jazz vocalist Gregory Porter. It’s a rapture of soul that shows how comfortable the brothers are in tripping between genres with confidence and style. “We’re still getting better and there’s no point taking a break - reflecting will come right at the end,” says Guy.",
			"Acknowledging their sophistication as writers and producers, however, does little to prepare fans for their live performance. Disclosure had some of the most memorable shows of the live touring circuit over the last few years and the new shows for Caracal will be even bigger and crazier. Just like the wild cat for which they named their album, Disclosure are a rare breed, and with that they’re completely unique and utterly independent in what they stand for and bring to the frontier of electronic music.",
			"On September 29, 2015, Disclosure took the stage at the Los Angeles Sports Arena with guest appearances by Lion Babe, Brendan Reilly, and Sam Smith. Fans who downloaded the UNSTAGED app could catch exclusive pre-show content and get a behind-the-scenes look at the show, only available in-app.",
			"Disclosure lovers around the world were also invited to customize their own personal Disclosure Face for a chance to be featured on stage during the live show, as well as in the gallery on amexunstaged.com and in the app. During a portion of the live performance, users’ submissions became part of the stage show, animating on screen as Guy and Howard performed. A stream of the submissions was also featured as an alternate camera angle available throughout the show. Once again, UNSTAGED provided fans with special access to one of their favorite artists, for those watching at home as well as those at the venue itself."

",
			"Some artists might be intimidated to consider where to go after achieving such success, but Goulding had no doubts: For her third album, Delirium, she wanted to make everything bigger, better, and braver. She says, “I knew I wanted it be on another level.” The result is an expansive pop album that lays out a new narrative for the next stage of Goulding’s remarkable journey. Delirium was written and recorded in London, Goulding’s native Herefordshire, Sweden, and Los Angeles with Max Martin, Greg Kurstin, One Republic’s Ryan Tedder, Klas Ahlund, and Disclosure’s Guy Lawrence, as well as long-time writing partner Jim Eliot. They have helped her craft a career-defining, jubilant, and euphoric pop statement.",
			"Delirium, is a word Goulding felt summed up everything she’d been through to get to this point. Goulding made Halcyon during a particularly difficult period in her life, but it is only now, she says, that she understands quite how emotional that album was for her. “It was a dark time, but I didn’t realize how dark until I started writing and recording the new album, and felt so much happier doing it. On Halcyon, I was clearly trying to express that darkness, like a cry for help. Making Delirium was, by contrast, a joyful experience. Delirium takes all the trademarks of Goulding’s talent — that extraordinary, soaring voice, the forensic candor and self-inquiry of her lyrics, the pulsing beats of the electronic music that first ensnared her as a teenager — and turns up the heat.",
			"“I know myself so well now,” she says. “There’s a new level of acceptance, and that comes from confidence. I used to be horribly shy when I started out. You can tell if you look at photographs of me from that time — the way I posed, the clothes I wore. I was uncomfortable in my own skin.” “I don’t come from a well-off background with supportive parents. I came from a not particularly great place and got myself to an amazing one. I used to be embarrassed about it, but not anymore. I couldn’t be more open — it’s gotten me all this way. And I think that’s pretty cool. I want that to be inspirational.”",
			"On November 11th, Ellie Goulding performed to a packed house at the Hammerstein Ballroom in NYC. She played a medley of old favorites and new hits from her just-released album, Delirium. Fans who downloaded the UNSTAGED app caught exclusive pre-show content showing Ellie getting pumped up to hit the stage. Additionally, in the UNSTAGED live feed, available only in-app, fans got an additional perspective of the concert – including a look at behind-the-scenes with the show’s director, Scarlett Johansson.",
			"The at home and in-venue audience had the unique opportunity to impact the live show by voting on various visual elements via Twitter. During the live show, fans voting outcomes were revealed and visually represented on stage with a shower of bubbles during ‘I Need Your Love’ and a burst of confetti during ‘Burn’. It was an awesome night where American Express once again gave fans around the world exclusive access to a fan-favorite artist like Ellie Goulding."
